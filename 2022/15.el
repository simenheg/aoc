;; Sensors and beacons always exist at integer coordinates. Each
;; sensor knows its own position and can determine the position of a
;; beacon precisely; however, sensors can only lock on to the one
;; beacon closest to the sensor as measured by the Manhattan
;; distance. (There is never a tie where two beacons are the same
;; distance to a sensor.)

;; It doesn't take long for the sensors to report back their positions
;; and closest beacons (your puzzle input). For example:

;; Sensor at x=2, y=18: closest beacon is at x=-2, y=15
;; Sensor at x=9, y=16: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
;; Sensor at x=13, y=2: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
;; Sensor at x=12, y=14: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
;; Sensor at x=10, y=20: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
;; Sensor at x=14, y=17: closest beacon is at x=10, y=16
;; Sensor at x=8, y=7: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
;; Sensor at x=2, y=0: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
;; Sensor at x=0, y=11: closest beacon is at x=2, y=10
;; Sensor at x=20, y=14: closest beacon is at x=25, y=17
;; Sensor at x=17, y=20: closest beacon is at x=21, y=22
;; Sensor at x=16, y=7: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
;; Sensor at x=14, y=3: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3
;; Sensor at x=20, y=1: closest beacon is at x=15, y=3

;; So, consider the sensor at 2,18; the closest beacon to it is at
;; -2,15. For the sensor at 9,16, the closest beacon to it is at
;; 10,16.

;; Drawing sensors as S and beacons as B, the above arrangement of
;; sensors and beacons looks like this:

;;                1    1    2    2
;;      0    5    0    5    0    5
;;  0 ....S.......................

;; 21 ............................
;; 22 .......................B....

;; This isn't necessarily a comprehensive map of all beacons in the
;; area, though. Because each sensor only identifies its closest
;; beacon, if a sensor detects a beacon, you know there are no other
;; beacons that close or closer to that sensor. There could still be
;; beacons that just happen to not be the closest beacon to any
;; sensor. Consider the sensor at 8,7:

;;                1    1    2    2
;;      0    5    0    5    0    5

;; This sensor's closest beacon is at 2,10, and so you know there are
;; no beacons that close or closer (in any positions marked #).

;; None of the detected beacons seem to be producing the distress
;; signal, so you'll need to work out where the distress beacon is by
;; working out where it isn't. For now, keep things simple by counting
;; the positions where a beacon cannot possibly be along just a single
;; row.

;; So, suppose you have an arrangement of beacons and sensors like in
;; the example above and, just in the row where y=10, you'd like to
;; count the number of positions a beacon cannot possibly exist. The
;; coverage from all sensors near that row looks like this:

;;                  1    1    2    2
;;        0    5    0    5    0    5
;;  9 ...#########################...
;; 10 ..####B######################..
;; 11 .###S#############.###########.

;; In this example, in the row where y=10, there are 26 positions
;; where a beacon cannot be present.

;; Consult the report from the sensors you just deployed. In the row
;; where y=2000000, how many positions cannot contain a beacon?

;; Your handheld device indicates that the distress signal is coming

;; To isolate the distress beacon's signal, you need to determine its
;; tuning frequency, which can be found by multiplying its x
;; coordinate by 4000000 and then adding its y coordinate.

;; In the example above, the search space is smaller: instead, the x
;; and y coordinates can each be at most 20. With this reduced search
;; area, there is only a single position that could have a beacon:
;; x=14, y=11. The tuning frequency for this distress beacon is
;; 56000011.

;; Find the only possible position for the distress beacon. What is
